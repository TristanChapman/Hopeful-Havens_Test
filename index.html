        <p>Hopeful Havens is a nonprofit organization based in Dublin that works to combat the housing crisis Ireland is currently facing. We work to provide affordable housing for individuals and families who have become homeless due to this crisis. Many of these people have found themselves without anywhere to call home simply because they cannot afford to pay the skyrocketing rent costs throughout Ireland. If they were to try and receive help from emergency or social housing, they could sit on a waiting list for many years just hoping to be approved. At Hopeful Havens we know that waiting years to have a place to call home is too long. That is why our organization works to build new buildings to house small apartments for the homeless or renovate existing buildings into small apartments so that we can combat this issue. Our goal is that by building these apartments we can help people find a place to live faster and begin decreasing the number of people who are homeless throughout Ireland. We believe that everyone deserves a chance to have a place to call home no matter how big or small that place might be!

        <p>Hopeful Havens was founded by Thomas Oâ€™Connell. Thomas grew up in Dublin, Ireland in a family that experienced homelessness intermittently throughout his childhood. After graduating from secondary school, Thomas received a scholarship to attend college at University College Dublin, where he pursued a degree in architecture. Upon receiving his degree, he worked in the field for a few years before deciding to do something more personal. Therefore, he decided to use his architectural skills to begin building small apartments in the Dublin area for the homeless to live in. This led him to found Hopeful Havens because he wanted to help those in Ireland who were experiencing varying levels of homelessness as it was something he was all too familiar with and did not want others to have to go through the same struggles he and his family did growing up. </p>

        <p>We offer 600 square foot apartments for the homeless to live in. Each apartment includes a bedroom with one or two beds, a full bathroom, a small living area with a couch, and a small kitchen equipped with a microwave, refrigerator, stove, and oven. Residents will pay $200 a month in rent to live in the apartments, but all payments will go towards the upkeep of the existing units and towards building more apartments so that more people will have a place they can afford to live in and call home. </p>
